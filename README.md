## Proposed Idea
For this assignment I would like to examine population growth data and visualize it through various different graphs. Specifically I would like to view these data sets as someone looking at the negative effects of overpopulation and it's strain on our resources.

## Overview
The program has four screens in total

* Menu Screen
... Simple splash screen with three options. Options can be selected with the mouse or with the keyboard.

*Graph 1 : Singapore (Localized data)
... A line graph showing the population growth in Singapore in recent years. The purpose of this graph is to show how population is steadily growing in a small(ish) subset.

*Graph 2 : World Population Growth
... Multiple line graphs showing population growth in recent years and projected population growth. The purpose of this graph is to show how how each region of the world correlates with each other, and hopefully graphically show the issue of how ridiculous our population is set to grow in the next decade.

*Graph 3 : World Map
... Shows population growth visually on a world map. The user can change the year using the scrollbar at the bottom to visually show the population growth.

## Reflection
I really enjoyed working on this assignment over all. It was real good practice working with classes and processing, as well as accessing external data. I'm the first to admit that I'm not the most artistically talented person out there, but I'm proud of the end result. There's still a couple of things I could still do with it and expand it, but If I was to keep working on it I'd never be fully satisfied, so I'm calling it finished.

The biggest problem I had was working with the .svg file for the map. That caused me a whole week worth of heartache to get it to work, but I'm happy with the way that it turned out in the end.
