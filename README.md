# Assignment1
Git repository for the Assignment. Assignment1_1 is the population increase in Singapore (localized data) whilst Assignment1_2 is the global population increase. At the moment (09/11/2015) I have some data sets nailed down and I've messed around with the Table class in processing to create some basic visualizations, albeit unfinished and buggy.

For this assignment I would like to examine population growth data and visualize it through various different graphs. Specifically I would like to view these data sets as someone looking at the negative effects of overpopulation and it's strain on our resources.
